# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are...

Name: Giorgio Vidali 


Project idea #1: Ethereum Wallet Tracking
-Working with crypto/nft is challenging because a lot of what happens in transactions goes under the radar, sometimes money is lost to gas fees, even for uncompleted transactions.
-As someone who is interested in this space, I have noticed I have trouble tracking how much money is coming in and how much is coming out, in other words, tracking profit and loss.
-The etherscan API, https://etherscan.io/apis, or https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview, will be tools used for this project
-The first method will be a simple P/L calculator, find the price of your current assets, and see if it outweighs how much you bought for them/lost in other transactions.
-The next method slightly simpler will display how much money you spent on gas fees, while this seems simple, it is a massive hidden fee. 
-The last thing is that you will see some historical graphs for the current ethereum price/number of transactions/prices of gas, to help the user get a feel for the current environment


Project idea #2: NFT Collection: Good price finder
-Input an nft collection from opensea api
-For each collection, there will be however many nfts each with a set number of attributes
-First I will display nfts by rarity for someone to explore
-Next to calculate good prices, for each property/attribute, I will look at the prices of each nft with that property. Then by using some statistics, maybe just calculating the average and returning anything two standard deviations under, I will return those nfts.
-There will also be an option to just put a wallet address and look at all the nfts that someone owns on opensea.

Either were accepted so I will do a combination of BOTH!! To create a small crypto eco systems:
-I will create a page to explore wallet fees and transactions
-A page to view all nfts attatched to a wallet
-A page to insert a collection name and find good prices


Week 4: Explore how to analyze wallets with the etherscan API, (COMPLETE), explore some web frameworks, Take some time putting NFTS onto web pages

Week 5: Try to spend more time actually getting my site organized, which might take a while because i havent built a website
with python for a really long time

Week 6: get to the nitty gritty with data analysis for nft prices, try to find statistics which may show which nfts are cheap

Week 7: Keep the analyis from nft prices and also try to add displaying nfts by rarity.

Week 8: by the end of week 8 the core three functioanlites of my site should be done: wallet tracking, nft price analysis, displaying nfts attached to wallet

Week 9: by the end of week 9 will really but my ux skills to work and make it look good
